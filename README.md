# Integration-LangChain-LlamaIndex
Choosing between frameworks like LangChain and LlamaIndex makes building Large
Language Model (LLM) applications seem like a formidable challenge. This approach
motivates the use of the unique features of both frameworks. LangChain and LlamaIndex have
some common ground and can even work together to solve some problems.
# Role of LlamaIndex in the combination:
LlamaIndex improves the overall efficiency of conversational search by converting raw data
into indexed forms and generating vector embeddings. This implies that when a LangChain
agent requests information, LlamaIndex may dynamically retrieve and index the necessary
data, making it ready for processing. LlamaIndex also provides tool abstractions for smooth
interaction with LangChain agents, allowing the query engine to search for information and
react to user requests effectively.
# Role of LangChain in the combination:
LangChain aims to improve the conversational capabilities of apps based on LLMs.
LangChain, by combining with tools such as LlamaIndex , enables the building of intelligent
agents capable of understanding and responding to user inquiries.
