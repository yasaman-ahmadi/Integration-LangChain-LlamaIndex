        "A **novel chatbot** driven by **Large Language Models (LLMs)** will be developed as part of this project to improve the user experience while asking questions about the Italian population in 2023. As part of the **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline**, the method makes use of the **complementary strengths** of the two frameworks **LangChain and LlamaIndex**. Each framework can focus on a different component of the pipeline when combined with the other, even though LangChain and LlamaIndex have certain common functions, especially in retrieval. Strong search techniques can be built with LlamaIndex's help, and agents may be made even more effective using LangChain. They form an impressive combination when used together. To efficiently manage user inquiries, the RAG technique incorporated **two open-source LLMs**: **Llama3 by Meta and Mixtral by Mistral**. In order to make the user experience more natural and effortless, these models mimic human behaviors while retrieving information.\n",
